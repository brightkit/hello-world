Introduction to github
I am just checking out the material in github.

  <h1>Just a little bit about myself</h1>
  <p>
    I have decided that I will add just a few lines on here by just rambling a little bit.
    The following languages though I have learned and want to brush back up on them to get
    back into working with coding again:
    <ul>
      <li>BASIC</li>
      <li>Pascal</li>
      <li>C++</li>
      <li>Java</li>
      <li>R</li>
      <li>Python</li>
      <li>SQL</li>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
